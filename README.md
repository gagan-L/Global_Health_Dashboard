# Global Health Insights Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the Global Health Insights Dashboard. This project harnesses the power of D3.js to bring interactive visualizations that highlight key health metrics across the globe. From geographical distributions to temporal changes in health indices, this dashboard is your window to understanding complex health data through intuitive visual formats.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the visual explorations, ensure you're set up with the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Our recommended code editor. It's lightweight, fast, and supports a multitude of extensions for different tasks. Get it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Live Server Extension for VS Code**: Facilitates a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.

## Project Components

This project comprises several key files and directories, each playing a crucial role in the visualization:

- `index.html`: The skeleton of our dashboard that hosts all other components.
- `main.js`: The brain behind our visual representations, handling data processing and visualization logic.
- `main.css`: The styling sheet that makes our data not just visible but visually appealing.
- `Dataset.csv`: The comprehensive dataset that feeds our visualizations with global health metrics.
- `world.geojson`: A geographical data file that enables the rendering of the global map in our dashboard.

## Running the Dashboard

To bring the dashboard to life on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Setup**: Clone or download this project to a directory of your choice on your local system.

2. **Open VS Code**: Navigate to the project directory in VS Code.

3. **Live Server**: With the Live Server extension installed, right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" or "Go Live". This launches your default browser displaying the dashboard.

4. **Explore**: Navigate through various visualizations, interact with the elements, and uncover insights into global health trends and metrics.

## Dashboard Features

- **World Map Visualization**: Dive into health metrics across different countries with interactive map features.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Explore various health indices over the years through interactive bar and pie charts.
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Get detailed metric insights by hovering over visualization elements.

## Feedback

Instead of a traditional contribution section, we encourage feedback to foster a collaborative and inclusive development environment. Feedback is vital for continuous improvement and innovation. Please share your insights, suggestions, and constructive criticism to help enhance the project. Feel free to open an issue or merge request on GitLab with your feedback or suggestions.

## Conclusion

Thank you for exploring the Global Health Insights Dashboard. We hope this tool not only provides you with valuable health insights but also inspires you to think more deeply about global health trends and their implications.
